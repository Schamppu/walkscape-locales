    newestRumor:
      name: A distant rumour?
      text: Hmm a distant rumour, huh? You know I am a cosmic being capable of obliterating your very mind, right? Guess we can have some fun tho! The whispers say that there's something ringing under the water right now in the bogs to the east, just waiting to be dug up.
    kallaheimBank:
      name: There is a bank in Kallaheim!
      text: I heard that <object id="location-kallaheim-094c9ec8-fdd2-4471-bacc-fabb71e6d654" /> has a bank where you can store your valuables safely. It's supposed to be well-guarded and very secure. If you're looking to keep your treasures safe and not get overencumbered, that's the place to go! Quite nice that you can withdraw them from any other banks too later!
    batTracking:
      name: Bat cave to the south.
      text: I've seen a lot of bats flying around that ruined trinketry bench tower far to the south of here. I bet if you peeked around in the cave over there for a bit, you could figure out where they migrate and maybe even follow them! You'd need a <object id="item-black_eye_peak_wilderness_permit-93acb97a-edf5-4b70-979b-90974ed79767" /> to get that way though! Should bring a few unique <object id="lightSource" /> options too!
    divingIntoTheWater:
      name: Diving into the water.
      text: Fancy a peek beneath th' waves? Try yerself one o' me finest <object id="item-rusty_diving_helmet-5cc98c65-6d8a-4137-bdff-1533e25ae14e" /> - pop it on, an' ye'll see clear as day underwater! Go on, give it a go! I ain't got a full kit no more, mind ye ... Bert at that blasted guild snatched the torso deal from under me nose, and the ships bringin' leggings? Lost to th' deep, every cursed chest of em. Still, if it's a helmet yer after, this be th' only port to dock in!
    skisFrusenholm:
      name: Skis to get around.
      text: I hear from the enthusiasts here that there are a lot of shortcuts to get around Jarvonia that'll require some <object id="skis" />. If you don't find any in the <object id="location-disenchanted_forest-bbaede29-74fb-4536-9c08-0693ffb0267d" /> you could go check <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to the east, heard they got a shop that sells some along with uncommon and rare ones!
    earlyWorkshop:
      name: Looking for a basic workshop?
      text: Always hear people looking to get into <object id="crafting" /> going off to <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to the east for their basic workshop. Might be worth checking out if you like clobbering together your own tools to be better than what the shops typically got. There's no bank there though, so you'd have to be prepared for the journey.
    goGetFrostbite:
      name: Big group headed to Frostbite Mountain.
      text: You missed a big scraggly group that had come in that were quite something, all going up to <object id="location-frostbite_mountain-0dc3b06f-c24c-4c5a-98d8-bb58606d9c8b" />. The miners took all the last copies of the <object id="item-jarvonian_crossword_puzzle-01c3fefd-6d9e-4b4d-bb76-91981c663085" />, while the berry foragers had some odd <object id="item-feather_cape-146534e2-c19f-4e93-a5f2-74c9f771471a" /> on. I think the serious climbers also had a shiny <object id="item-iron_thermos-091fc314-babd-4840-b663-693cf4dfb37f" /> among them.
    gBug:
      name: Aww Geez.
      text: There's this odd letter 'g' I keep hearing people talk about. Apparently, something good will happen if you find it and give it a touch. Odd superstition to bank on.
    blewSocksOff:
      name: Scattered socks.
      text: A dreadful wind came through the city the other day amidst a big transaction of ... <object id="item_socks" />. Scattered them everywhere! I know, sounds ridiculous, but now people are finding them in all sorts of litter piles around the area. Probably reek of shrimp too amid a potentially discarded <object id="item-simple_torch-e7454cd9-897e-4f4a-a1c1-f272d383d3cf" />.
    easierReputation:
      name: Reputation?
      text: Having a hard time fulfilling some of the job requests and getting the locals to like you? I heard the requested jobs they have in the south only get harder but have better payoffs. Though if those are proving difficult, I heard some younger folks got their hands on some good materials for some <object id="activity-sledding-290bfd6c-3bb1-47c6-bf60-880c1d4a5148" /> near the springs to the south. Maybe if you help them out while making a game of it, you'll get some appreciation!
    startSkydisc:
      name: Start some skydisc golf.
      text: Looking to try out some of my signature <object id="frisbee" />? Maybe you'd want to try the <object id="activity-frisbee_golfing_(beginner)-0fb41f4d-f46b-4a6d-acdf-f2525654c714" /> southwest of here I've heard opened up? In Bourbontalk? I dunno, I get the names of places wrong sometimes.
    startSki:
      name: Start skiing better.
      text: Want to get better toward using some of my more advanced <object id="skis" />? Could start on that area down south of here, the <object id="location-casbrant_fields-6f038903-6682-4113-b4e8-dbb7be8e3c60" />. Heard there's a good enough space for <object id="activity-cross-country_skiing_(beginner)-fc421940-d63a-402f-aa50-26cc2efea4d3" /> there.
    usefulTools:
      name: You'll need tools!
      text: I've heard all sorts of artisans are needing help lately. So look, you're gonna need the right tools for the job! Need a <object id="smithingHammer" />? Bam! I got <object id="item-simple_hammer-738f4d46-5fe8-4329-923e-d03bbdd35b23" />! A <object id="carpentryTool" />? Bam! Got a <object id="item-simple_saw-2ea8dfc5-c0b7-48a0-9aaa-664ec3001318" />! Next? A <object id="craftingTool" />? Oh ho ho, we got a <object id="item-simple_wrench-9f29bed7-9c9c-41a0-8639-0bf63b3cbb30" /> for that! Huh? Oh, a <object id="goldPan" />? Shoot, well guess I can't help you there ... gotcha! <object id="item-simple_gold_pan-b471a71f-699e-40d1-96dc-8f2bc168ebf7" /> right here! You get the idea!
    icyGlacier:
      name: Adventure to the north!
      text: Hear that glacier up north has something worth exploring there! Would need to get your hands on a <object id="item-mysterious_northern_map-efb3664f-a694-4e79-991f-b083702bcde1" /> to probably find the way.
    woodCrazy:
      name: Anything in the woods?
      text: I live away from the town in the middle of the woods and you are asking me if I hear anything? You bet I do, these trees don't shut up and their roots go deep! Rip them all down! Bet you could do it easier with some <object id="item-tree_scaling_claws-f4c9e4d5-103d-45b1-956d-60f86c8ada7d" /> after some <object id="activity-firewood_making-407263a4-4ee1-4383-a624-2a7ed70c4b10" />! Get to it!
    fortAround:
      name: A way around the fort?
      text: A way around?! Think I'd just tell you if there was one?! No hope without getting your hands on a <object id="item-jarvonian_letter_of_passage-0119b9e6-2ea9-4e13-965a-9c0579ac61a4" />! Stubborn? Just go ahead and grow gills or sprout wings like a bat! Disgusting creatures! Everyone should stay away from those things whenever they see them coming.
    betterSkiing:
      name: Better skiing.
      text: Well on the other side of the fort, I've heard that there's some good <object id="activity-cross-country_skiing_(intermediate)-42788047-6cc3-4711-88be-999e9504fc2a" />. Lots of skiers say they train doing that for a bit before they can use their <object id="item-oak_skis-1e12faeb-01bc-45b6-96a7-d289db257de5" /> or better.
    myFineJob:
      name: Looking 'Fine'.
      text: I hear you might be taking a look at the jobs I post on my aptly named <object id="jobboard-tutorial_area-43c4e231-2f03-4acb-b976-e4a239ad3cf9" /> outside. Now sometimes I ask for the occasional <c>'FINE'</c> version of something, they are rarer to find in place of the normal materials out there. Make sure you grab some free materials I give out daily to help craft up tools to equip to help you out with that on an activity!
    rumorsAround:
      name: Listening in?
      text: Make sure you give a listen to other people around! They might have a good 'Rumour' or two they'll share with you! I heard they'll sometimes even talk about things you can note down in your 'WalkPedia'! Like how there's <object id="060e6d39-4fa1-404f-b2e2-3bcc0e4ec2cd" /> down in the <object id="location-pit_of_pittance-49a851b8-0a55-4857-9492-907958733b09" />!
    hauntedSaw:
      name: Haunted sawmill?
      text: I hear the occasional murmur that in <object id="location-barbantok-018aaeeb-5b51-4043-94b7-28fa7dcb7b7a" /> there's this <object id="service-sawmill_of_barbantok-bcf66d09-179f-4979-90d3-65333a263ad6" /> and that it's haunted! It seems to be extra efficient though, so maybe it's a friendly spirit? Cut those logs up!
    huntingTreasure:
      name: Lost treasure?
      text: Nearby people have been reporting losing and finding items of importance in the area lately. Might be time to do a little <object id="activity-horn_of_respite_treasure_hunt-5e83ae40-970b-491b-9474-134a180bdd49" /> to see if you can turn up any of the lost items. Let's see, the rarest sounding item here. Ah, looks like someone lost their <object id="item-artificial_snowflake-d8cee7e8-4f8c-4df9-8c1c-6636bb70b16d" />? I can only imagine how difficult that'd be to find in this snowy area.
    blackeyeDanger:
      name: Black Eye Peak?
      text: Got a <object id="item-black_eye_peak_wilderness_permit-93acb97a-edf5-4b70-979b-90974ed79767" /> and looking to go <object id="activity-mountain_climbing_(intermediate)-812aa739-645f-4ff3-ac6e-61b0153b9351" /> up at <object id="location-black_eye_peak-8761f944-595a-4d1c-9e5d-af90952abde6" />? Be careful, bring some <object id="climbingTool" />. I would recommend seeing if you can find a <object id="item-mountaineering_guidebook-cf6d8aa8-08a4-4717-934c-4632d2a18fb4" />, though plenty of people I knew had one while doing that and still didn't make it back.
    spelunkingAway:
      name: Spelunking venture.
      text: What could be more exciting than exploring cavernous depths with some <object id="activity-spelunking-45b8d041-f27e-434e-8bdc-bbd6d5c9eec8" /> up at <object id="location-black_eye_peak-8761f944-595a-4d1c-9e5d-af90952abde6" />?! Well, as long as you can come back in one piece of course, tough work bringing back just the remains of others sometimes. Though I suppose lots of people delve into those deep dark caverns in search of that lost civilization's <object id="item-ancient_ankh-01fa6eaa-3605-4597-abd6-1ffb7a4bd104" /> and other traces of its existence.
    lostIceSickle:

      text: I used to also sell a <object id="item-blue_ice_sickle-377a162f-a7b4-411c-931c-2b2333b25909" />, but I tripped and lost em across the glacier, so you'd need to do some <object id="activity-glacier_foraging-dfdd59cc-e38b-48fc-9a0e-439163abac12" /> if you'd ever want one. Probably pretty difficult though blending in with all the ice around here. Probably be like, what's that expression the humans use? Finding a needle in a haystack?

    swampWoods:
      name: Careful of the swamp!
      text: Heard that people sometimes go <object id="6c70f4e7-a31c-49c7-8e12-e9df8c5d00aa" /> from here and find themselves in the middle of the swamp, I'd advise caution if you find yourself tempted to do so - gotta be plenty dark in there to need an extra <object id="lightSource" />. I'd be too afraid to fall into some random bog I couldn't see - I would need <object id="itemset_diving_gear_advanced" />! Haha!
    soFlowy:
      name: So flowy!
      text: I love a good breeze! I've seen some of the traceurs around here in some <object id="item-flowy_trousers-cb41184e-5b1e-41f5-8c34-53379ab30192" />. I'd love to get my hands on a pair, but I'm no good at <object id="activity-rooftop_jumping_(intermediate)-d0178a77-1163-4ae1-af09-c5314ef3427d" />. Must feel so freeing!

He's a bit sullen sometimes, but I know how to crack a smile out of him! Just gotta bring over my <object id="item-golden_frisbee-cf01b261-8bc5-4ecf-8581-ff029bb8ee39" /> that I had sent to me from <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to play with him at the nearby <object id="activity-frisbee_golfing_(intermediate)-ecbf8887-6555-4d43-b044-e8e05eac556c" />!

They have the <object id="f3f5e3e3-7dfd-4752-9e57-145c67827ffb" /> there! Gotta make sure to bring your wallet with you! Was so funny to see Borus forget his one time and had to go grab it before they'd let him in! Hahaha!
    morusForHorus:
      name: Please don't go find Horus.
      text: My brother Horus? Oh no, please don't go looking for him at the Gold'n Grail in <object id="location-everhaven-609377ac-b6b6-4c63-95c2-6abc2f9a19af" />. You'll just hear so many things about us that no one needs to hear. Are you sure you wouldn't prefer going there for the <object id="521b90e7-0974-4ce0-94d6-71b841afe5f5" /> instead? Or just not at all actually? Too much risk of being blown over a ledge there with the strong winds and lack of city walls!
    morusForBorus:
      name: Beware if you journey to Borus.
      text: My brother Borus? Gosh, he is just so confident and brave to run the Gold'n Grail at the <object id="location-blackspell_port-c03285fc-37a1-4b06-ba76-45e91948b3aa" /> location. Hear plenty of stories about people going missing to giant snakes in those parts near the swamp. If you ever <object id="36cb0325-c006-4ef6-98fa-ae4ac028b4e8" /> by accident there and don't know how to get out, you should <object id="44f2997a-b8d9-4786-8f21-9dd7dd028c44" />. Probably end up at those spooky ruins nearby, but better than snake food!
    borusForHorus:
      name: Horus has great peppy stories!
      text: My good brother Horus! He's over at the Gold'n Grail in <object id="location-everhaven-609377ac-b6b6-4c63-95c2-6abc2f9a19af" />! You gotta pay him a visit! There's a nice girl over that area too at the Breeze Mart, she loves hearing Horus tell a good story. She sells some cool stuff too. I've seen a <object id="item-simple_magnet-9ce10587-d651-4a3d-9b0b-195ecd44152d" /> and <object id="item-simple_bug_catching_net-d7df05f9-f59e-462a-9498-9f0c43409c42" />. Bet you could use them for some fun activities!
    borusForMorus:
      name: Morus tells great spooky stories!
      text: Good brother Morus! He's over there trying his best at the Gold'n Grail in <object id="location-bilgemont_port-3487fbca-62e3-4a6c-8f91-ceacdc6ea382" />, even though he says he hates it! He'll do anything to help and has a keen eye! He even helped be an <object id="8512e656-ae65-4e42-979f-8e9a7b9ee099" /> over here for a bit, even found a <object id="f7d3d27f-941b-4f4c-9358-d4d1191ce51d" /> in the collection! Though I heard there might be a few more hiding out there.
    borusShipping:
      name: Ship it!
      text: There's some good views down by the docks! The ships over here always need <object id="activity-ship_repair_(intermediate)-44f2f2e7-bef1-437f-ac35-bf64b97cc249" />, feels like the area always has a <object id="item-sailor's_hat-5eee0ec0-5bb1-446f-a083-72d987c0ced4" /> somewhere. Sure is a lot of interesting language used around there.
    waveBodySurf:
      name: Good waves for bodysurfing?
      text: I really need to get back over to the <object id="location-red_coast-2e988edb-141d-4f3e-b06f-0eb7a88aef4b" /> over to the east. I heard the waves are for good <object id="activity-swimming_(intermediate)-37f761f4-f6fd-49a5-8389-5816388e0cf9" /> over there! They say people go out there needing a <object id="item-life_vest-69df4746-247d-468c-b9e7-295ea9bf8101" /> and end up leaving them behind because they feel they become such good swimmers! I'd still want one to go <object id="activity-kayaking-72c1d122-8796-40c0-bbbb-32fdd741e528" /> at the nearby ruins!

Calls it <object id="activity-magnet_fishing-abeba70d-d8f6-48cc-8161-f9dea7a49d44" />! Says he mostly pulls up trash, but every now and then, a <object id="item_ring" /> or two. Heard he once even snagged an <object id="item-old_war_sword-479cf57c-2467-4bfb-8d46-781b9a0fa589" />!
    butterflyEffect:
      name: The butterfly effect?
      text: I heard some couples have been making their way down to <object id="location-warrenfield-74631484-e2ab-472c-8697-d3d4a1d91b8e" /> with a <object id="bugCatchingNet" /> to do some <object id="activity-butterfly_catching-ddef8fc5-a61e-4689-bacb-e49ee89f09c8" />. Apparently romantic to try catching them to release them in front of one another. Guaranteed a happy relationship if you can find a <object id="item-blue_lotus_butterfly-65a6c2ae-ccde-4e7a-82b0-e28f89316359" /> too. Some people even wait til night to show off <object id="item-fireflies_in_a_jar-0ad11117-c89c-467f-ae85-5de3c8c4b7c3" /> they catch.

I heard people that stand out helping even get a <object id="item-soup_kitchen_badge-9ca3e2a2-9a4b-498c-8655-9fdb3b8a391d" /> to give them access to their prestigious kitchen for their own personal benefit! Though it still means dealing with all the other people using it at the same time I guess.

      text: After my friend taught me that grapes are toxic to dogs, I had to take out my anger by going <object id="activity-wine_grape_stomping-d86f36a3-e612-48b8-825d-17a885e9b3f1" />. I stomped so much into wine that day. They said any more and I probably would have turned it into liquid enough to find a lost <object id="item-eberhart_corkscrew-d91f1c7f-b616-4489-a1a4-a9b2064d4e0d" /> at the bottom of the vat! Haha!
    hiddenCave:
      name: A hidden cave.
      text: I heard that some people are finding their way into the bogs after following some bats. Apparently, this leads them to a secret cave of some sort over there. Probably finds them a different way into the swamp altogether too.

Don't think they'd be needing them anymore if you find any.

Probably can find a few if you go <object id="activity-wreck_diving-12e980cd-058a-42c4-8358-ba7afe1c319c" /> around there.

      text: You should go try <object id="activity-wreck_diving-12e980cd-058a-42c4-8358-ba7afe1c319c" />! We went out there and found a <object id="item-mark_of_the_deep_one-7eaf06be-f34f-4aed-a4cc-b0832a5f4795" />, maybe there's some more left for you to grab one!

I heard that the Undercurrent sells such a thing, so you'll need to be chummy with us Syrenthians. Guessing you'd want it to help <object id="acitivity-explore_underwater_cave-3ea73f48-f20c-4f1b-bf3d-53574c1e9aec" /> then? Sounds like that'll be quite a dark journey into the unknown.

      text: You're interesting, asking that of someone who can breathe underwater. I think I've heard tales though of some that went <object id="activity-kelp_foraging-c10960b3-e454-4ecf-8841-04762073b7e5" /> from the nearby <object id="location-kelp_forest-2f3842c6-11b0-4b3c-be4b-bdbcf58dc0a6" /> and cooked it into some <object id="item-hardened_kelp-d65b9c9d-142c-413a-8100-53da10963aa2" /> to make <object id="itemset_diving_gear_advanced" />.

Maybe you'll even impress enough to earn a <object id="item-merfolk_dress-302f07a9-b862-4b84-912e-d04cbd3d36b8" /> or get a <object id="item-letter_from_a._a.-810dc007-df32-435f-9d38-49a384e23060" /> Haha!

Seen that they can be made into some decent tools when combined with other hardened materials, especially at the amazing <object id="service-tidal_workshop-75f6cf9e-a64b-499d-84e5-5a560d63bbd7" /> here.

You might not find much if you go <object id="activity-fossil_mining-f0cbd3f2-8ec3-4df9-8ead-931c2e1de2e1" /> there. I heard there's a few types of fossils hiding there, but they're brittle. The most I heard someone getting out of there was a <object id="item-seahorse_fossil-b0ca93ea-f8bf-4bbc-af95-7827023187cb" />, so I can only imagine how difficult any others left there must be to get.

You'll need a <object id="lightSource" /> and <object id="itemset_diving_gear_expert" /> at least to go with your <object id="fishingSpear" />. Maybe if you fend off enough of them, you'll scare them into an <object id="item-anglerfish_mask-c6bdf94c-f6f4-4d81-acff-46051d3a61f7" /> and turn the tides.
