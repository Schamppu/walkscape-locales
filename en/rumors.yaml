  jarvonia:
    kallaheimBank:
      name: There is a bank in Kallaheim!
      text: I heard that <object id="location-kallaheim-094c9ec8-fdd2-4471-bacc-fabb71e6d654" /> has a bank where you can store your valuables safely. It's supposed to be well-guarded and very secure. If you're looking to keep your treasures safe and not get overencumbered, that's the place to go! Quite nice that you can withdraw them from any other banks too later!
    batTracking:
      name: Bat cave to the south!
      text: I've seen a lot of bats flying around that ruined trinketry bench tower far to the south of here. I bet if you peeked around in the cave over there for a bit, you could figure out where they migrate and maybe even follow them! You'd need a <object id="item-black_eye_peak_wilderness_permit-93acb97a-edf5-4b70-979b-90974ed79767" alwaysShow="true" /> to get that way though! Bring a couple <object id="lightSource" /> too!
    divingIntoTheWater:
      name: Diving into the water!
      text: Try out one of my <object id="item-rusty_diving_helmet-5cc98c65-6d8a-4137-bdff-1533e25ae14e" alwaysShow="true" />, putting it on will allow a better view underwater! Why not try one on? Though I don't have stock of a full set here for a proper excursion ... Bert at that guild got lucky he won the torso trade deal over me, and those ships carrying chests of legging shipments all seemed to never make it. Still, this is the only place you'll find these helmets!
    skisFrusenholm:
      name: Skis to get around!
      text: I hear from the enthusiasts here that there are a lot of shortcuts to get around Jarvonia that'll require some <object id="skis" />. If you don't find any in the <object id="location-disenchanted_forest-bbaede29-74fb-4536-9c08-0693ffb0267d" alwaysShow="true" /> you could go check <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" alwaysShow="true" /> to the east, heard they got a shop that sells some along with uncommon and rare ones!
    earlyWorkbench:
      name: Looking for a workbench?
      text: Always hear people looking to get into <object id="crafting" /> going off to <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" alwaysShow="true" /> to the east for their decent workbenches. Might be worth checking out if you like clobbering together your own tools to be better than what the shops typically got. There's no bank there though, so you'd have to be prepared for the journey.
    goGetFrostbite:
      name: Big group headed to Frostbite Mountain!
      text: You missed a big scraggly group that had come in that were quite something, all going up to <object id="location-frostbite_mountain-0dc3b06f-c24c-4c5a-98d8-bb58606d9c8b" />. The miners took all the last copies of the <object id="item-jarvonian_crossword_puzzle-01c3fefd-6d9e-4b4d-bb76-91981c663085" alwaysShow="true" />, while the berry foragers had some odd <object id="item-feather_cape-146534e2-c19f-4e93-a5f2-74c9f771471a" alwaysShow="true" /> on. I think the serious climbers also had a shiny <object id="item-iron_thermos-091fc314-babd-4840-b663-693cf4dfb37f" alwaysShow="true" /> among them.
    gBug:
      name: Aww Geez!
      text: There's this odd letter 'g' I keep hearing people talk about. Apparently something good will happen if you find it and give it a touch. Odd superstition to bank on.
    blewSocksOff:
      name: Scattered socks!
      text: A dreadful wind came through the city the other day amidst a big transaction of ... <object id="socks" />. Scattered them everywhere! I know, sounds ridiculous, but now people are finding them in all sorts of litter piles around the area. Probably reek of shrimp too amid a potentially discarded <object id="item-simple_torch-e7454cd9-897e-4f4a-a1c1-f272d383d3cf" />.
