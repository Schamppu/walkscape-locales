    newestRumor:
      name: A new rumor?
      text: Hmm a new rumor, huh? You know I am a cosmic being capable of obliterating your very mind, right? Guess we can have some fun tho! The whispers say that there's something ringing under the water right now in the bogs to the east, just waiting to be dug up.
    kallaheimBank:
      name: There is a bank in Kallaheim!
      text: I heard that <object id="location-kallaheim-094c9ec8-fdd2-4471-bacc-fabb71e6d654" /> has a bank where you can store your valuables safely. It's supposed to be well-guarded and very secure. If you're looking to keep your treasures safe and not get overencumbered, that's the place to go! Quite nice that you can withdraw them from any other banks too later!
    batTracking:
      name: Bat cave to the south!
      text: I've seen a lot of bats flying around that ruined trinketry bench tower far to the south of here. I bet if you peeked around in the cave over there for a bit, you could figure out where they migrate and maybe even follow them! You'd need a <object id="item-black_eye_peak_wilderness_permit-93acb97a-edf5-4b70-979b-90974ed79767" /> to get that way though! Bring a couple <object id="lightSource" /> too!
    divingIntoTheWater:
      name: Diving into the water!
      text: Try out one of my <object id="item-rusty_diving_helmet-5cc98c65-6d8a-4137-bdff-1533e25ae14e" />, putting it on will allow a better view underwater! Why not try one on? Though I don't have stock of a full set here for a proper excursion ... Bert at that guild got lucky he won the torso trade deal over me, and those ships carrying chests of legging shipments all seemed to never make it. Still, this is the only place you'll find these helmets!
    skisFrusenholm:
      name: Skis to get around!
      text: I hear from the enthusiasts here that there are a lot of shortcuts to get around Jarvonia that'll require some <object id="skis" />. If you don't find any in the <object id="location-disenchanted_forest-bbaede29-74fb-4536-9c08-0693ffb0267d" /> you could go check <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to the east, heard they got a shop that sells some along with uncommon and rare ones!
    earlyWorkshop:
      name: Looking for a basic workshop?
      text: Always hear people looking to get into <object id="crafting" /> going off to <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to the east for their basic workshop. Might be worth checking out if you like clobbering together your own tools to be better than what the shops typically got. There's no bank there though, so you'd have to be prepared for the journey.
    goGetFrostbite:
      name: Big group headed to Frostbite Mountain!
      text: You missed a big scraggly group that had come in that were quite something, all going up to <object id="location-frostbite_mountain-0dc3b06f-c24c-4c5a-98d8-bb58606d9c8b" />. The miners took all the last copies of the <object id="item-jarvonian_crossword_puzzle-01c3fefd-6d9e-4b4d-bb76-91981c663085" />, while the berry foragers had some odd <object id="item-feather_cape-146534e2-c19f-4e93-a5f2-74c9f771471a" /> on. I think the serious climbers also had a shiny <object id="item-iron_thermos-091fc314-babd-4840-b663-693cf4dfb37f" /> among them.
    gBug:
      name: Aww Geez!
      text: There's this odd letter 'g' I keep hearing people talk about. Apparently something good will happen if you find it and give it a touch. Odd superstition to bank on.
    blewSocksOff:
      name: Scattered socks!
      text: A dreadful wind came through the city the other day amidst a big transaction of ... <object id="socks" />. Scattered them everywhere! I know, sounds ridiculous, but now people are finding them in all sorts of litter piles around the area. Probably reek of shrimp too amid a potentially discarded <object id="item-simple_torch-e7454cd9-897e-4f4a-a1c1-f272d383d3cf" />.
    easierReputation:
      name: Reputation?
      text: Having a hard time fulfilling some of the job requests and getting the locals to like you? I heard the requested jobs they have in the south only get harder but have better payoffs. Though if those are proving difficult, I heard some younger folks got their hands some good materials for some <object id="activity-sledding-290bfd6c-3bb1-47c6-bf60-880c1d4a5148" /> near the springs to the south, maybe if you help them out while making a game of it, you'll get some appreciation!
    startSkydisc:
      name: Start some skydisc golf!
      text: Looking to try out some of my signature <object id="frisbee" />? Maybe you'd want to try the <object id="activity-frisbee_golfing_(beginner)-0fb41f4d-f46b-4a6d-acdf-f2525654c714" /> southwest of here I've heard opened up? In Bourbontalk? I dunno, I get the names of places wrong sometimes.
    startSki:
      name: Start skiing better!
      text: Want to get better toward using some of my more advanced <object id="skis" />? Could start on that area down south of here, the <object id="location-casbrant_fields-6f038903-6682-4113-b4e8-dbb7be8e3c60" />. Heard there's a good enough space for <object id="activity-cross-country_skiing_(beginner)-fc421940-d63a-402f-aa50-26cc2efea4d3" /> there.
    usefulTools:
      name: You'll need tools!
      text: I've heard all sorts of artisans are needing help lately. So look, you're gonna need the right tools for the job! Need a <object id="smithingHammer" />? Bam! I got <object id="item-simple_hammer-738f4d46-5fe8-4329-923e-d03bbdd35b23" />! A <object id="carpentryTool" />? Bam! Got <object id="item-simple_chisel-d871d278-5795-44ec-8d0c-c41c8715e3b8" /> and <object id="item-simple_saw-2ea8dfc5-c0b7-48a0-9aaa-664ec3001318" />! Next? A <object id="craftingTool" />? Oh ho ho, we got a <object id="item-simple_wrench-9f29bed7-9c9c-41a0-8639-0bf63b3cbb30" /> for that! Huh? Oh, a <object id="goldPan" />? Shoot, well guess I can't help you there ... gotcha! <object id="item-simple_gold_pan-b471a71f-699e-40d1-96dc-8f2bc168ebf7" /> right here! You get the idea!
    icyGlacier:
      name: Adventure to the north!
      text: Hear that glacier up north has something worth exploring there! Would need to get your hands on a <object id="item-mysterious_northern_map-efb3664f-a694-4e79-991f-b083702bcde1" /> to probably find the way.
    woodCrazy:
      name: Anything in the woods?
      text: I live away from the town in the middle of the woods and you are asking me if I hear anything? You bet I do, these trees don't shut up and their roots go deep! Rip them all down! Bet you could do it easier with some <object id="item-tree_scaling_claws-f4c9e4d5-103d-45b1-956d-60f86c8ada7d" /> after some <object id="activity-firewood_making-407263a4-4ee1-4383-a624-2a7ed70c4b10" />, get to it!
    fortAround:
      name: A way around the fort?
      text: Another way through?! Think I'd just tell you if there was one?! No hope without getting your hands on a <object id="item-jarvonian_letter_of_passage-0119b9e6-2ea9-4e13-965a-9c0579ac61a4" />! Stubborn? Just go ahead and grow gills or sprout wings like a bat! Disgusting creatures! Everyone should stay away from those things whenever they see them coming.
    betterSkiing:
      name: Better skiing?
      text: Well on the other side of the fort, I've heard that there's some good <object id="activity-cross-country_skiing_(intermediate)-42788047-6cc3-4711-88be-999e9504fc2a">. Lots of skiers say they train doing that for a bit before they can use their <object id="item-oak_skis-1e12faeb-01bc-45b6-96a7-d289db257de5"> or better.

    swampWoods:
      name: Careful of the swamp!
      text: Heard that people sometimes go <object id="6c70f4e7-a31c-49c7-8e12-e9df8c5d00aa" /> from here and find themselves in the middle of the swamp, I'd advise caution if you find yourself tempted to do so - gotta be plenty dark in there to need an extra <object id="lightSource" />. I'd be too afraid to fall into some random bog I couldn't see - I would need <object id="itemset_diving_gear_advanced" />! Haha!
    soFlowy:
      name: So flowy!
      text: I love a good breeze! I've seen some of the traceurs around here in some <object id="item-flowy_trousers-cb41184e-5b1e-41f5-8c34-53379ab30192" />. I'd love to get my hands on a pair, but I'm no good at <object id="activity-rooftop_jumping_(intermediate)-d0178a77-1163-4ae1-af09-c5314ef3427d" />. Must feel so freeing!
    horusForMorus:
      name: Morus in Bilgemont Port!
      text: My brother Morus? He's over at the GG in <object id="location-bilgemont_port-3487fbca-62e3-4a6c-8f91-ceacdc6ea382" />! He's a bit sully sometimes, but I know how to crack a smile out of him! Just gotta bring over my <object id="item-golden_frisbee-cf01b261-8bc5-4ecf-8581-ff029bb8ee39" /> that I had sent over from <object id="location-frusenholm-5ddb0735-4582-4858-80a0-7489f1b043a2" /> to play with him at the nearby <object id="activity-frisbee_golfing_(intermediate)-ecbf8887-6555-4d43-b044-e8e05eac556c" />!
    horusForBorus:
      name: Borus in Blackspell Port!
      text: My brother Borus! He's at the GG in <object id="location-blackspell_port-c03285fc-37a1-4b06-ba76-45e91948b3aa" />! They have the <object id="f3f5e3e3-7dfd-4752-9e57-145c67827ffb" /> there! Gotta make sure to bring your wallet with you! Was so funny to see Borus forget his one time and had go grab it before they'd let him in! Hahaha!
