        description: Several players have reported issues with their step charts being inaccurate, caused by major behind-the-scenes changes in a previous update. If you encounter problems where the charts show significantly different readings than other sources, this is the most likely reason. The game logic itself should still work as before and the chart issues will be addressed in future updates.
